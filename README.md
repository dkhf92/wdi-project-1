Introduction

This Memory Game can be enjoyed as one player or multiplayer. It is based on the game Simon says, in this case "Simon" is the computer. This is my first project on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.
The game can be played here: https://mysterious-forest-15504.herokuapp.com/
You can watch my code here: https://github.com/dkhf92/wdi-project-1

How to play

The 4 boxes will flash in a sequence, your objective is to imitate the computers sequence. For every flash there is also a sound connected to it. There is a valid sound and an invalid sound. If a box flashes with the invalid sound, it is removed from the computer sequence and you are to leave it out when you try to imitate the computer.
